# Multi-Tenancy Support

## 1. Introduction to Multi-Tenancy
Multi-tenancy is a software architecture pattern that allows multiple tenants to share a single system instance while ensuring data isolation between tenants. This enables resource reuse, unified upgrades and maintenance, standardized data analysis, and large-scale promotion.

OpenMeta natively supports two multi-tenancy modes: shared application with shared database mode, and shared application with independent database mode. Once multi-tenancy is enabled, data is automatically isolated by tenant.

## 2. Enabling Multi-Tenancy

### 2.1 Multi-Tenancy Mode 1: Shared Application with Shared Database
Enable multi-tenancy by setting `system.multi-tenancy.enable` in the configuration file. For example:
```yaml
system:
  multi-tenancy:
    enable: true
```

### 2.2 Multi-Tenancy Mode 2: Shared Application with Independent Database
Since OpenMeta supports [dynamic multi-data sources](./datasource), the `UserInfo` object includes `tenantId` and `datasourceKey` fields.

When a user logs in, these fields can be populated in the `ContextInterceptor` interceptor implementation.

Enable multi-tenancy and database isolation in the configuration file:
```yaml
system:
  multi-tenancy:
    enable: true
    isolated-database: true
spring:
  datasource:
    dynamic:
      enable: true
      datasource:
        tenant1:
          driver-class-name: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
          url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/demo
          username: user0
          password: pass0
        tenant2:
          driver-class-name: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
          url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/db1
          username: user1
          password: pass1
        tenant3:
          driver-class-name: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
          url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/db2
          username: user2
          password: pass2
```

## 3. Multi-Tenancy Data Model
Once multi-tenancy is enabled, data isolation can be configured at the model level.

**Conditions for Enabling Tenant Isolation in Models**:
- Set the model metadata `multiTenant = true`. This `multiTenant` attribute controls which data models are subject to tenant isolation. Models with `multiTenant = false` can be shared across tenants.
- Add a `tenantId` field to the model. This field is globally read-only and is populated with the `tenantId` of the current user upon creation. Modifying this field is not allowed.

## 4. Data Isolation Strategies Between Tenants
Once multi-tenancy is enabled, the ORM enforces strict isolation and validation. The current user's `tenantId` is recorded in the context (`user.tenantId`).

### 4.1 Simple Queries
The ORM automatically appends a tenant filter condition to the `WHERE` clause:
```sql
tenant_id = user.tenantId
```

### 4.2 JOIN Queries
The tenant filter condition is automatically appended to both the main table and the related tables without requiring developer intervention:
```sql
t0.tenant_id = user.tenantId AND t1.tenant_id = user.tenantId
```

### 4.3 Data Creation
During data creation, the ORM automatically populates the `tenantId` field:
```java
tenantId = user.tenantId
```

If the client specifies a `tenantId` that differs from the current user's `tenantId`, the system will throw an exception, indicating a potential unauthorized access attempt.

### 4.4 Data Updates
Since the `tenantId` field in the data model is read-only, the ORM ignores any attempts to modify the `tenantId`.

### 4.5 Data Deletion
Before deletion, the ORM checks the data scope, ensuring that only data belonging to the current user's tenant can be deleted.

## 5. Multi-Tenant System Operations Platform
Operating a multi-tenant system requires cross-tenant data access for tenant management, data configuration, and analysis.

### 5.1 Operations Platform Without Tenant Isolation
The operations platform should deploy separate front-end and back-end services with a unique access domain. In this system, multi-tenancy should not be enabled, i.e., `system.multi-tenancy.enable = false`.

### 5.2 Tenant Properties in the Operations Platform
In the operations platform, tenants are treated as an attribute of data authorization. The `tenantId` field in data models serves only as a cross-tenant data authorization condition. Even if the data model includes a `tenantId` field, it is not subject to multi-tenancy restrictions enforced by the ORM layer.
